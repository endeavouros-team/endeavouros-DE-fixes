lxqt: can use autostart desktop files.. 

config? no clue.. seems it has default ones under `/usr/share/lxqt/` but they are not completely what you will have on first login and seesm stuf fis getting added on the fly to them.. so using echo to add the favorite icons to the panel.

Currently used for testing in this package:
https://github.com/endeavouros-team/PKGBUILDS/tree/master/endeavouros-skel-lxqt-git

Later it will be this using tarballs instead of latest git:
https://github.com/endeavouros-team/PKGBUILDS/tree/master/endeavouros-skel-lxqt (not ready)
