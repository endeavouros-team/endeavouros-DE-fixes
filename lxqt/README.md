lxqt: can use autostart desktop files.. 

config? no clue.. seems it has default ones under `/usr/share/lxqt/` but they are not completely what you will have on first login and seems stuff is getting added on the fly to them.. (combining different configs together) so currently using **echo** to add the favorite icons to the panel configuration.

Currently used for testing in this package:
https://github.com/endeavouros-team/PKGBUILDS/tree/master/endeavouros-skel-lxqt-git

Later it will be this using tarballs instead of latest git:
https://github.com/endeavouros-team/PKGBUILDS/tree/master/endeavouros-skel-lxqt (not ready)
